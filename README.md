# scx_truther

⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

scx_truther is NOT a real scheduler.
It does NOT optimize performance.
It is NOT suitable for production use.

This project exists purely as:
- a demonstration of scx_rustland_core
- a teaching tool for sched-ext
- a non-competitive example scheduler

If you are looking for performance, you are in the wrong repository.

## What does it do?

Nothing useful.

It registers as a sched-ext scheduler and tells you the truth.

## How to run

```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/scx_truther
```
